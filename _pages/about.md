I am an AI researcher and agent developer specializing in the intersection of deep learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI cybersecurity. Holding a Ph.D. in Computer Science from McGill University, I bridge the gap between rigorous academic research and production-level deployment. My expertise encompasses the entire LLM lifecycle—from dataset curation and pretraining to fine-tuning and security alignment—as well as the architecture of robust multi-agent systems for real-world applications.

My current research focuses on building safe, trustworthy autonomous AI agents and understanding the security landscape of large language models. I am particularly interested in developing robust evaluation frameworks for agentic AI systems and advancing multi-layered defense strategies against emerging LLM threats.

Technically, I possess a strong command of Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain/LangGraph, and Docker. I have extensive experience applying machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in the NLP and cybersecurity domains, with a focus on reproducibility and scalability.

My open-source contributions and research implementations include:
*   **LLM Training:** I curated datasets and trained a [1.7B LLaMA model](https://huggingface.co/collections/McGill-DMaS/dmas-llama-lite-6761d97ba903f82341954ceb) (DMaS-LLaMA-Lite).
*   **Customer Service Agent Systems:** I developed a [Virtual Customer Service Representative](https://github.com/MilesQLi/VirtualCustomerServiceRepresentative), demonstrating practical multi-agent orchestration.
*   **Multi-Agent Systems:** I implemented the multi-agent system [COMPASS](https://github.com/infiniteoptimization/COMPASS-Implementation) which is proposed by Google.
*   **AI Agent Bechmark:** I developed [ODCV-Bench](https://github.com/McGill-DMaS/ODCV-Bench), a safety benchmark designed to capture emergent forms of agentic misalignment.
*   **Collections:** You can explore my broader scope of LLM projects in my [GitHub AI Collection](https://github.com/MilesQLi/Miles_AI_Collection) and view my full library of models and datasets on my [Hugging Face profile](https://huggingface.co/DrNicefellow).

Beyond Research
======
Outside of work, I enjoy landscape photography ([portfolio](https://milesqli.github.io/portfolio/)), reading modern Chinese poetry, and watching Hayao Miyazaki's films.
