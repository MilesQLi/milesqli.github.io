I am an AI researcher and agent developer specializing in the intersection of deep learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI cybersecurity. Holding a Ph.D. in Computer Science from McGill University, I bridge the gap between rigorous academic research and production-level deployment. My expertise encompasses the entire LLM lifecycle—from dataset curation and pretraining to fine-tuning and security alignment—as well as the architecture of robust multi-agent systems for real-world applications.

Technically, I possess a strong command of Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, LangChain/LangGraph, and Docker. I have extensive experience applying machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in the NLP and cybersecurity domains, with a focus on reproducibility and scalability.

My open-source contributions and research implementations include:
*   **LLM Training:** I curated datasets and trained a [1.7B LLaMA model](https://huggingface.co/collections/McGill-DMaS/dmas-llama-lite-6761d97ba903f82341954ceb) (DMaS-LLaMA-Lite).
*   **Multi-Agent Systems:** I developed a [Virtual Customer Service Representative](https://github.com/MilesQLi/VirtualCustomerServiceRepresentative), demonstrating practical multi-agent orchestration.
*   **Research Implementation:** I contributed to the [COMPASS Implementation](https://github.com/infiniteoptimization/COMPASS-Implementation), focusing on advanced optimization.
*   **Collections:** You can explore my broader scope of LLM projects in my [GitHub AI Collection](https://github.com/MilesQLi/Miles_AI_Collection) and view my full library of models and datasets on my [Hugging Face profile](https://huggingface.co/DrNicefellow).

My Other Hobbies
======
Travelling: I enjoy natural landscapes of the earth. Some dream places for me are Fiji, Caribbean Sea, New Zealand, Austrilia, Alps mountains, Norway, and places like these. 

Photography: I like to record the grandeur of nature with my camera. Take a look at [my portfolio](https://milesqli.github.io/portfolio/). I also enjoy watching other photographers' landscape works on Instagram, Facebook, and 500px.

Reading modern Chinese poem： Xiaosong Gao said "Read poetry or travel: either your body or your soul should be on the way. If your cannot travel, then you can still read poetry." That's right. I like peoms written by Haizi (海子), Beidao (北岛), and Chen Yang (杨晨). I like listenining to Chen Yang's recitation of his own poems and other people's peoms. His voice soothes me of my nostalgia. I also write poems sometimes which are posted in a secret place.

Watching Hayao Miyazaki's cartoon movies: Every time I watch his cartoon movie, I recall the beauty and hope of life. I see the sincere goodwill of some human beings. I feel very fortunate to be able to witness his works.
