I am a self-motivated researcher and data scientist with a strong technical background in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLMs). I specialize in developing scalable machine learning solutions for real-world applications, with experience spanning both academic research and industry collaborations.

With a Ph.D. in Computer Science from McGill University, I combine rigorous deep learning research with production-level deployment skills. I’m proficient in PyTorch, Hugging Face, and modern ML pipelines, and have mentored graduate students and cross-functional teams.


My work on LLMs involves hands-on experimentation with LLMs, including dataset curation, pretraining, fine-tuning, and building agent-based or retrieval-augmented systems. I am also experienced in applying ML techniques to solve practical problems in NLP and cybersecurity domains—ranging from interpretable malware detection to customer churn prediction.


You can find the 1.7B LLaMA model I trained on my [Huggingface collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/McGill-DMaS/dmas-llama-lite-6761d97ba903f82341954ceb). My other LLM projects can be found on my first [Github account](https://github.com/MilesQLi/Miles_AI_Collection) and second [Github account](https://github.com/MeNicefellow) and the LLMs I trained/finetuned and the datasets I curated can be found on my [Huggingface page](https://huggingface.co/DrNicefellow).

In addition to academic projects, I’ve taken initiative to bridge the gap between research and *business* by *analyzing real-world datasets* on platforms like *Kaggle* and *AICrowd*, and participating in *job simulations* through Forage to better understand the role of data scientists in business environments.

My Other Hobbies
======
Travelling: I enjoy natural landscapes of the earth. Some dream places for me are Fiji, Caribbean Sea, New Zealand, Austrilia, Alps mountains, Norway, and places like these. 

Photography: I like to record the grandeur of nature with my camera. Take a look at [my portfolio](https://milesqli.github.io/portfolio/). I also enjoy watching other photographers' landscape works on Instagram, Facebook, and 500px.

Reading modern Chinese poem： Xiaosong Gao said "Read poetry or travel: either your body or your soul should be on the way. If your cannot travel, then you can still read poetry." That's right. I like peoms written by Haizi (海子), Beidao (北岛), and Chen Yang (杨晨). I like listenining to Chen Yang's recitation of his own poems and other people's peoms. His voice soothes me of my nostalgia. I also write poems sometimes which are posted in a secret place.

Watching Hayao Miyazaki's cartoon movies: Every time I watch his cartoon movie, I recall the beauty and hope of life. I see the sincere goodwill of some human beings. I feel very fortunate to be able to witness his works.
